`fs-extra` adds file system methods that aren't included in the native `fs` module and adds promise support to the `fs` methods. It should be a drop in replacement for `fs`.

`fs-extra` is a drop in replacement for native `fs`. All methods in `fs` are attached to `fs-extra`. All `fs` methods return promises if the callback isn't passed.
