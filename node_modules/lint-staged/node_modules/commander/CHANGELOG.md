## [5.0.0] (2020-03-14)

### Added

* support for nested commands with action-handlers ([#1] [#764] [#1149])
* `.addCommand()` for adding a separately configured command ([#764] [#1149])
* allow a non-executable to be set as the default command ([#742] [#1149])
* implicit help command when there are subcommands (previously only if executables) ([#1149])
* customise implicit help command with `.addHelpCommand()` ([#1149])
* display error message for unknown subcommand, by default ([#432] [#1088] [#1149])
* display help for missing subcommand, by default ([#1088] [#1149])
* combined short options as single argument may include boolean flags and value flag and value (e.g. `-a -b -p 80` can be written as `-abp80`) ([#1145])
* `.parseOption()` includes short flag and long flag expansions ([#1145])
* `.helpInformation()` returns help text as a string, previously a private routine ([#1169])
* `.parse()` implicitly uses `process.argv` if arguments not specified ([#1172])
* optionally specify where `.parse()` arguments "from", if not following node conventions ([#512] [#1172])
* suggest help option along with unknown command error ([#1179])
* TypeScript definition for `commands` property of `Command` ([#1184])
* export `program` property ([#1195])
* `createCommand` factory method to simplify subclassing ([#1191])

### Fixed

* preserve argument order in subcommands ([#508] [#962] [#1138])
* do not emit `command:*` for executable subcommands ([#809] [#1149])
* action handler called whether or not there are non-option arguments ([#1062] [#1149])
* combining option short flag and value in single argument now works for subcommands ([#1145])
* only add implicit help command when it will not conflict with other uses of argument ([#1153] [#1149])
* implicit help command works with command aliases ([#948] [#1149])
* options are validated whether or not there is an action handler ([#1149])

### Changed

* *Breaking* `.args` contains command arguments with just recognised options removed ([#1032] [#1138])
* *Breaking* display error if required argument for command is missing ([#995] [#1149])
* tighten TypeScript definition of custom option processing function passed to `.option()` ([#1119])
* *Breaking* `.allowUnknownOption()` ([#802] [#1138])
  * unknown options included in arguments passed to command action handler
  * unknown options included in `.args`
* only recognised option short flags and long flags are expanded (e.g. `-ab` or `--foo=bar`) ([#1145])
* *Breaking* `.parseOptions()` ([#1138])
  * `args` in returned result renamed `operands` and does not include anything after first unknown option
  * `unknown` in returned result has arguments after first unknown option including operands, not just options and values
* *Breaking* `.on('command:*', callback)` and other command events passed (changed) results from `.parseOptions`, i.e. operands and unknown  ([#1138])
* refactor Option from prototype to class ([#1133])
* refactor Command from prototype to class ([#1159])
* changes to error handling ([#1165])
  * throw for author error, not just display message
  * preflight for variadic error
  * add tips to missing subcommand executable
* TypeScript fluent return types changed to be more subclass friendly, return `this` rather than `Command` ([#1180])
* `.parseAsync` returns `Promise<this>` to be consistent with `.parse()` ([#1180])
* update dependencies

### Removed

* removed EventEmitter from TypeScript definition for Command, eliminating implicit peer dependency on `@types/node` ([#1146])
* removed private function `normalize` (the functionality has been integrated into `parseOptions`) ([#1145])
* `parseExpectedArgs` is now private ([#1149])

### Migration Tips

If you use `.on('command:*')` or more complicated tests to detect an unrecognised subcommand, you may be able to delete the code and rely on the default behaviour.

If you use `program.args` or more complicated tests to detect a missing subcommand, you may be able to delete the code and rely on the default behaviour.

If you use `.command('*')` to add a default command, you may be be able to switch to `isDefault:true` with a named command.

### Migration Tips

#### Testing for no arguments

If you were previously using code like:

```js
if (!program.args.length) ...
```

a partial replacement is:

```js
if (program.rawArgs.length < 3) ...
```
